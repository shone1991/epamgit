Shorty said she grown she got confidence, but on her own she got options
When we get alone she likes to pop shit
Fuck what are we gonna do with your counterfeit
Shorty please back it on it, I'll give you money for the conslet
When I'm alone with you it blows my confidence
When I'm with you I need more confidence.

Girl don't let them hold you down cuz you came from the bottom, and we don't live for tomorrow, you can kiss me with your eyes closed
It's easier when you really fucking mean it, dont it make you wanna show off, show me love till the last call

Shorty said she grown she got confidence, but on her own she got options
When we get alone she like to pop shit
Fuck what are we gonna do with your counterfeit
Shorty please back it on it I'll give you money for the conslet
When I'm alone with you it blows my confidence
When I'm alone with you I need more confidence
